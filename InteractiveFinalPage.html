<p>2.  You are running a marathon. You are wearing a blue shirt and wearing a pair of neon green Nike vaporflys. There are 10,000 people running with you. You start strong, a consistent eight minute mile. You find yourself doing well, in 50th place. After a couple hours you see people trailing behind you; you are speeding up. At mile 15 you are in 8th place, at mile 22, 4th. You come across mile 25 and see the man in second. You give it your all, pushing your body to its limit, beads of sweat turn to rivers that flow from your forehead as your body burns and stings from the miles behind you. You dig, put your head down. You look up; he is behind you. What position are you in?
